* Once the user has started a save icon will appear in the top right hand corner of the page. 
* After the note is completed to the user's liking, click the save icon to save the note. 
* The saved note will then be displayed on the left hand side of the screen as a list. 
* The user can then click the title of the list item for it to be displayed on the body of the page. 
* Each list item will also have a red trashcan symbol signifying a delete option. 
* The user can click this to remove the saved note if they no longer deem it necessary. 
* The user can also click the "+" symbol located on the top right hand corner to begin a new note if they are currently viewing a previous note. 
* If the user would like to return to the main page, click the "Scribe" header located on the top left hand corner of the page to be redirected back to the main page.
